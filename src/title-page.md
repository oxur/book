# The Oxur Programming Language

Adapted from *The Rust Programming Language*, by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community

This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.90.0 (released 2025-09-18)
or later with `edition = "2024"` in the *Cargo.toml* file of all projects to
configure them to use Rust 2024 Edition idioms. See the [“Installation” section
of Chapter 1][install]<!-- ignore --> for instructions on installing or
updating Rust, and see [Appendix E][appendix-e]<!-- ignore --> for information
on editions.

The HTML format is available online at
[https://oxur.github.io/book/stable/](https://oxur.github.io/book/stable/)
and offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup doc
--book` to open.
