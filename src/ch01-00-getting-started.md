# Getting Started

Let’s start your Oxur journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

- Installing Rust and Oxur on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`
- Using `cargo`, Rust’s and Oxur's package manager / build system
